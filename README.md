# Moira's Matrix

## Welcome to Moira's Matrix

"Moira's Matrix" is not just a home lab, but a sanctuary for exploring the art of reverse engineering and the science of advanced threat analysis. Named with a whimsical charm, this lab is where I, an aspiring cybersecurity enthusiast, delve deep into the digital world's mysteries.

## Exploration and Experimentation

This lab is a non-production environment, embodying the essence of freedom and curiosity. It's a place where operational constraints are non-existent, facilitating in-depth cybersecurity explorations.

## Key Projects and Challenges

- **Reverse Engineering Platforms:** Regular engagement in challenges from [Root Me](https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en), [CrackMes.one](https://crackmes.one/), and [Pwnable.kr](http://pwnable.kr/), enhancing problem-solving skills and cybersecurity knowledge.
- **NSA Codebreaker Challenge:** Active participation in the 2022 and 2023 challenges, contributing to GaTechâ€™s winning team.

## Academic Enhancement

During my MS in CyberSecurity, I took a pivotal course:
- **[CS 4717 - Introduction to Reverse Engineering](https://saltaformaggio.ece.gatech.edu/teaching/spring2021/intro-re/):** Applied lab experiences to reverse engineer malware like Michelangelo.1, DOS-7, SQLSlammer, Lucius, and Harulf.

## Home Lab Setup

- **Tools and Technologies:** The lab is equipped with a secure sandbox, virtual machines for dynamic analysis, and tools like IDA Pro, Ghidra, and x64dbg for comprehensive malware analysis.

## Purpose and Note

The activities and setups in "Moira's Matrix" are solely dedicated to educational and personal skill development.
